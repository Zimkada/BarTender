OTHER METRICS (Accessibility, Best-Practices, SEO):
====================================================
- Accessibility: Maintained at 80-92 range (very stable, -3 change in Consignations only)
- Best-Practices: PERFECT 100/100 maintained on all pages
- SEO: PERFECT 100/100 maintained on all pages
- PWA: Not tracked in either audit cycle

CRITICAL FINDINGS:
==================

WINNERS (Significant Improvement):
- Homepage & Vente Rapide: Both improved 33% (matching improvements suggest shared component fix)
- Historique: Strong improvement of 27% (second best)
- Parametres: Good improvement of 15%

LOSERS (Significant Regression):
- Previsions: CRITICAL - Dropped 36% (potential new features without optimization)
- Accounting: MAJOR - Dropped 26% (similar heavy computation page)
- Equipe: Moderate - Dropped 19%

OBJECTIVE TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT:
================================

Question: "Is performance actually improved?"

ANSWER: PARTIALLY AND INCONSISTENTLY

The data shows:
1. Light pages (UI-heavy) improved significantly due to optimizations
2. Heavy pages (data-heavy computation) regressed, suggesting added complexity or new dependencies
3. Net improvement is marginal at +0.25% average across all pages
4. Accessibility, Best-Practices, and SEO all remained stable or perfect
5. The pattern suggests targeted optimization of core user flows (Homepage, Quick Sale)
6. Backend/admin pages (Previsions, Accounting) need remediation

PROBABILITY ASSESSMENT:
- Performance improved on consumer-facing features: 95% confident (Homepage improved 33%)
- Performance regressed on admin/data pages: 98% confident (Previsions dropped 36%)
- Overall improvement claim is OVERSTATED: Yes, improvements are real but offset by regressions

RECOMMENDATIONS:
=================
1. Investigate Previsions page regression - likely new features/data loads added
2. Optimize Accounting page - heavyweight calculation page needs attention
3. Deploy Homepage/Vente Rapide optimizations to other pages
4. Continue monitoring mobile performance - current optimizations help light pages but hurt heavy ones
5. Consider code-splitting or lazy-loading for data-heavy pages
